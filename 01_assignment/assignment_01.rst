Assignment 01: Tensors and Einsum
=================================

In this assignment you will implement several tensor operations from scratch
using Python and PyTorch tensors.  All code should be written in
``src/assignment_01.py``.  Starter code with vector/tensor initializations,
function headers, and assertion-based tests is already provided. **Please do not
modify the test code**.

Task 1: Dot Product
====================

The *dot product* of two vectors :math:`\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in
\mathbb{R}^n` is defined as

.. math::

   \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k \cdot b_k

**Your task:** Implement the function ``dot_product(a, b)`` in
``src/assignment_01.py``. Use a python ``for`` loop to iterate over the elements of the input vectors. The function should be written in a way that it can handle vectors of any length (not just the provided length of 100).

----

Task 2: Matrix-Matrix Multiplication
======================================

The matrix product :math:`C = A \cdot B` for
:math:`A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}`,
:math:`B \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}` and
:math:`C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}` is defined element-wise as

.. math::

   c_{pr} = \sum_{q=0}^{k-1} a_{pq} \cdot b_{qr}

This corresponds to the einsum ``pq, qr -> pr``.

**Your task** has two parts:

1. **Implement the function** ``matmul_loops(A, B)``: compute :math:`C = A \cdot B` using nested ``for`` loops. No PyTorch matrix-multiply operations are allowed inside this function.

2. **Implement the function** ``matmul_dot(A, B)``: compute the same product but reuse
   your ``dot_product`` function from Task 1. To do so, use loops over the ``dot_product`` function that uses slices of the input matrices as 1-D views.

----

Task 3: Einsum ``acsxp, bspy -> abcxy``
=========================================

Given tensors

.. math::

   A \in \mathbb{R}^{a \times c \times s \times x \times p}, \quad
   B \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times s \times p \times y}

the target einsum ``acsxp, bspy -> abcxy`` computes

.. math::

   C_{abcxy} = \sum_{s} \sum_{p} A_{acsxp} \cdot B_{bspy}

You can assume a static shape for the tensors, ``A: (2, 4, 5, 4, 3)``, ``B: (3, 5, 3, 5)`` and ``C: (2, 3, 4, 4, 5)``

**Your task** has two parts:

1. **Implement the function** ``einsum_loops(A, B)``: use ``for`` loops to iterate over all index dimensions, accumulating the products into a pre-allocated output tensor.
2. **Implement the function** ``einsum_gemm(A, B)``: compute the same einsum but reuse one of your matrix multiplication implementations from Task 2. To do so, use loops over the matrix multiplication function that uses slices of the input tensors as 2-D views.


Optional Task: Tensor Permutation and Reshaping
===============================================

Look up ``torch.permute`` and ``torch.reshape`` in the PyTorch documentation
and experiment with them inside a new python file. Try to answer the
following questions:

* How do ``.shape`` and ``.stride()`` change after a ``torch.permute`` or ``torch.reshape`` call?
  Does the underlying data move in memory?
* How does ``torch.reshape`` differ from ``torch.view``?
* Why can reshaping a permuted tensor be handled differently than reshaping
  a freshly created tensor?  (Hint: check ``.is_contiguous()`` before and
  after ``torch.permute``).
